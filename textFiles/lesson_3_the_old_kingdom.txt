King Menes created the first Egyptian dynasty after joining Upper and Lower Egypt.
The old kingdom saw to the construction of the great pyramids of Egypt, 
which were for the burial of Pharaohs and their families. To this day, 
over 30 great pyramids have been built. The largest of all of the pyramids
was believed to be the Great Pyramid of Giza, which took an estimated 20 years 
and over 2 million stones. The great Sphinx is a half man half lion statue,
built to protect the Great Pyramid.
