The middle kingdom is best known for its language and 
visual arts. Artists of this time followed a formulaic style 
when illustrating, and followed this method for thousands
of years. The written forms of communication among 
ancient Egyptians were hieroglyphics and the hieratic script.
Hieroglyphics are symbols, resembling pictures, which were 
very complicated to write. Only the middle and higher
classes were able to learn this form of writing. The hieratic
script was a simplified version of hieroglyphics, which was
used for business and administrative purposes.
