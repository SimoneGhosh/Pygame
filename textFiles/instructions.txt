Welcome to Poisonous Pyramids! We offer a lesson, interactive review, a quiz,
 and results. Use your cursor to click the option you would like on the 
main menu. We recommend studying the lesson then playing the review game, 
completing the quiz to test your knowledge, and then viewing your final results. 
You can retake the quiz as many times as you would like! If at any 
time you would like to return to the main menu, press the return key on your 
keyboard. If you would like to exit the pygame window, click on the "x" on 
the window screen, or click the escape button on your keyboard.
