The Nile River: over 6437 km, flows into the Mediterranean sea. In Ancient 
Egyptian Religion, Hapi was believed to be the Egyptian god of the Nile.
The Nile’s annual flooding deposits nutrient-filled sediments onto the river banks.
This land was called “Kemet” or “Black land”. The dry desert land was called 
“red land”. The land in the south is referred to as upper Egypt, the north side 
is called lower Egypt. Naturally, we would think the “upper” land would be in
the north, but because the Nile River flows from south to north, due to its higher 
elevation, the south is called the upper land.
