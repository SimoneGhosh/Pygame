You began to eat a delicious fresh pomegranate and begin 
munching away. The snake smells the sweet scents of the 
pomegranate from afar and is lured in by its smell. But
once it arrives, it sees you eating the pomegranate! 
The snake wants the pomegranate for itself, so it attacks
you and you die a slow, painful death. The snake 
then dines on the pomegranate feeling no remorse.
